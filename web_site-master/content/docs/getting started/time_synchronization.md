A phone application has been developed to allow you to synchronize the date and time of the BabyLogger depending on your time zone.

### Instructions:

- **What is needed: a phone application (Android only)** :
  - An Android phone is required to use the application (no IOS support currently).
  - Download the time synchronization application, [here](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/object/packages.babycloudlab.com/ble_init.apk?region=eu-west-1&tab=overview) onto your phone.
  - Alternatively, you can also download the application from the email received by the *Echolalia Team*, by double clicking on the **[APK](xxx)**.
  - Make sure that you have the application installed on your phone.
    
- **The process** :
  - Power on the bluetooth of your phone.
  - In order to modify the date and time on the BabyLogger, you need to charge the logger AND be connected to the phone application via the bluetooth of the logger.
  - Pair the phone with the logger bluetooth name **"BabyLogger"** with password **"123456"**. You have 10 minutes to update the time. If the process is not completed during that time, you will have to start over.
  - Once the logger is connected to your phone, the LED of the logger will change from RED (charging  mode) to <span style="color:green">**GREEN** </span>/<span style="color:red">**RED** </span>.
  - Open the application and click on the **Update Time** button.
  - Now, the LED will switch to <span style="color:red">**RED** </span> only, which means that the Baby Logger has correctly synchronized with your Timezone.

**Note: you should synchronize the time of your logger, right after receiving it, and also every time that it has been powered off for several weeks.**
